Recieved the D3 sample from Monita. After QCing, clear issues with the files;

```
- MSstats reports > 10GB
- Protein and peptide lvl quant identical
```

For now, need to focus on comparing the different tools. The SEC-MS comparison has already been performed by Ben, so for me now to focus on D3

Summarize to protein level and do a QC between the samples

Also combine with the 'cleaned' DT samples and generate the QC plots, as people will ask for this comparison (also D1?)

Then focus on analysis: PCprophet, CCprofiler & BPprofiler and SECUAT
