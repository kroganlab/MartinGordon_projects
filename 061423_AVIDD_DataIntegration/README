## Data Integration work for the AvIDD data

Meeting on 06/13/23
A couple of options to pursue for Data Integration.
Broadly can be cateogrised into:
- Network propagation: Ben's code for Network Prop & the IGVER group (NetColoc - ref in medneley) have some nice ideas to breaking up the larger network into smaller modules
- Matrix Factorisation: R packages mixOMmics & MOFA (MOFA used by another research group we work with, so maybe a good place to start?)

For now, will try Network Propagation as this is what the AVIDD group are expecting and with BP feedack should be able to turn around faster

Roadmap for NetProp:
- Compute S matrix from a background network: for this, I will use a String netowrk, which one?
- 

Considerations:
- Batch Effects? Can I control for these in the different experiment types?
