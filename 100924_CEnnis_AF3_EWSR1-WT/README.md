Set up AF3 runs for the 3 protein structures; what does the original structure look like for both proteins, then do the fusion
Align the two original and the fusion protein

All 3 of these proteins produced really poor models... < 30 PTM

Are these proteins and the fusion available in the PDB? Look at these versions vs our alphafold models
Also perform a MSA of these fasta

Why is WT-1 fasta shorter than one available on uniprot? Is there a different alias
