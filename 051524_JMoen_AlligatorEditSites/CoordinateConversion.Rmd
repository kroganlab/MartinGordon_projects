```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Need to convert the coordinates of the edit sites on Alligator to human; how many of these match?
Find genes that match

```{r cars}
library(rtracklayer) #interface to genome Anno and UCSC
library(GenomicRanges) # represent & manipulate genomic intervals
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
