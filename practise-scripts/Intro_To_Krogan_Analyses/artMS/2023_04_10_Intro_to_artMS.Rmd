# set up the directory (don't run)...
don't run this chunk if you received the full data with this file.  (It won't work anyways) This serves as a record of the data source.
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mkdir ~/UCSF/kroganlab/BenPolacco/random2022/2023_04_10_Intro_to_artMS_data/dir
cd  ~/UCSF/kroganlab/BenPolacco/random2022/2023_04_10_Intro_to_artMS_data/dir

# artMS needs four files to run
cp  ~/Box/Vaccinia_Monkeypox_colab/Abundance/artMS.MSstats/dir/evidence.txt ./
cp  ~/Box/Vaccinia_Monkeypox_colab/Abundance/artMS.MSstats/dir/keys.txt ./
cp  ~/Box/Vaccinia_Monkeypox_colab/Abundance/artMS.MSstats/dir/contrast.txt ./
cp  ~/Box/Vaccinia_Monkeypox_colab/Abundance/artMS.MSstats/dir/config.yaml ./

mkdir output

# running artMS is as easy as passing a config.yaml file to artMS

And when it works, its great to get a lot of things done at once... 

```{r}
# paths in config.yaml must work relative to working directory
# update path below depending on your current working directory
setwd("2023_04_10_Intro_to_artMS_data/")

library('artMS')

artMS::artmsQuantification("dir/config.yaml", display_msstats = TRUE)
```
