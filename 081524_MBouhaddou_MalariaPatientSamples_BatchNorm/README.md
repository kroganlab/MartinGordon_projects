Data shared by previous lab member Medhi 

Malaria proteome project that is under review at BMC Infectious Disease (Nevan knows about this project). 
Aisha and Charles, students at the University of Ghana, are working on it. This work is part of Aisha’s masters thesis that she is trying to wrap up. 
Aisha collected plasma from children in two areas of Ghana, one known to have high malaria transmission (HMT) and one with low malaria transmission (LMT).
 There are a total of 60 samples, 30 from each site, across 3 time points post-infection/diagnosis/hospital visit/treatment (0 days, 7 days, 21 days). 
 
 So, all of these things happened on the same day? post-infection/diagnosis/hospital visit/treatment

 Patents received antimalarial treatment on day 0. The samples were processed for MS in two batches, 30 samples each, and run on the MS separately. 

I was wondering if you would have time to take a look at the data and suggest an analysis approach to remove some of this variability (batch-level, patient-level) for us to get good adjusted p-values (this was one of the reviewers comments we are trying to address). We have tried combat and other statistical analysis softwares (DEP) but nothing has worked for us (been trying for many months now…). Oddly, Andrea was able to get good adjusted p-values, but he no longer has access to his original files.
