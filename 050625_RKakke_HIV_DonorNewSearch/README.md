SEC_MS analysis of HIV-infected donor CD4-t cells

Follow-up of `040825_MMuralidharan_PCProphet_HIV_CD4Tcellls`

Conditions: Mock/uninfected, challenged, infected

Want to compare all conditions, but mock vs infected seems the key condition to focus on

**Notes**

Donor1 sample problematic; most of the cells were dead, so need to assess QC to determine if a fourth donor is needed

**Todo**

- Donor 1 samples have been researched with new fasta showing improved recovery of viral proteins; reanalyze this dataset
- Donor 2 samples have been uploaded; process alongside Donor 1 and see if the same complexes are recovered
- Identify host-viral complexes with similiar elutions profiles; heatmaps and linecharts may be a good way to summarize this information
