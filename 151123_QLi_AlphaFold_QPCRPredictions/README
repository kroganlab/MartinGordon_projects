## Alphafold prediction of interactions between GPCRs and G-Proteins

Firstly, check Wynton usage, seems to be busy atm
Also check the AlphaFold structure dbs https://www.alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/api-docs to see if these interactions, or at least these 
individual proteins, have already been run
Are the structures for alphafold already available in PDB? If I search the sequences of these proteins in the AlphaFold 
structure DB, is there proteins with similar sequences with predicted structures available?

OPRM1 is the only receptor with a representative of the supplied GPCRs in the PDB... this could indicate the predictions will 
be poor? Check alphafold DB

Notes
----
BP mentioned storing the output of the predictions (does he mean the individual chains?)
Want to store the output of the MSAs as this is the most time consuming aspect of the run
To recover the MSAs, needs to look in features.pkl file; 
- script to recover the features.pkl file, write to a outdir with a directoryname of the 

If so we could write something to i) before running alphafold, search the Alphafold DB to find if this has already been run and 
ii) when running if the structure is novel, save the alignments somewhere for reuse

Copy the files remotely

Test run of multimer with the 6 proteins listed
Lets investigate the output afterward and load pickle file into R to create the script

What about a nf-pipeline for alphafold?
Use my script to pull in the two sequences, concatenate them into a single fa file and run alphafold using that with multimer preset?
Then as long as the correct accession is provided, it should be relatively easy to run, but maybe more effort than its worth..
