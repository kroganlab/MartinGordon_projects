CRISPRe deep mutational screen of PIK3ca pathway 
Pathway plays important role in cell growth, signalling and survival
Commonly impacted pathway in cancers; mutations in key genes (eg PIK3ca) can contribute to cancer progression
Goal is to disrupt key effectors of the PIK3ca pathway: TSC1, TSC2, PIK3ca, PDK1, AkT1, MTOR, PTEN
Designed CRISPR guides to target clinvar sites of clinical significance; sequenced these
