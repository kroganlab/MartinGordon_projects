First Goal
## Functional prediction of impacts of CRISPR mutants
Format the file we have in excel to process with one of the functional prediction tools
First check if these tools can accept mutliple sites impacted 



## fa method
coordinates are 1-based
Variants must be on the + strand of the assembly to be detected

# i think we might need to change the site info to match positive strand
For now upload what we have and see if it throws an error


# this is my code for tracking process of first submission
