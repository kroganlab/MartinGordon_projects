**Summary of output (so far..)**

Number of edits recovered in files

**RNAseq**

~50k high quality edits recovered in each of the RNAseq OL

~6k in the Gill

**Riboseq**

~15k high quality edits in RiboSeq OL (excl. the alt prep)

~3k in Gill

**Split Bams & DE analysis**

We then split the bam files into aligned edited and non-edited transcripts in protein coding transcripts, and performed differential analysis on this set

**Issues**

Sequencing depth in the edited bams

FP edits reported? Just 10bp coverage, no frequency threshold, no paired DNAseq sample to filter SNPs/seq errors... Only use transcripts/edit previously reported..


**TODO**

For now, just confirm the analysis on my side looks OK and msg JM with update
