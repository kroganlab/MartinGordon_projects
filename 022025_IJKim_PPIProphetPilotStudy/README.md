Recover the ID mapping Andrea used in his publication and share with Ben

He used a tool for ORF detection using the two genomes... We can try rerun this tool, but maybe first lets share the filtered fasta for the two containing only the records that map to the transcripts

Recovered ID mapping for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other two genomes, no uniprot available, so I guess he just searched against the fasta, although the annotations in the `phipa3.fasta` are different  from the annotations used for the results..
