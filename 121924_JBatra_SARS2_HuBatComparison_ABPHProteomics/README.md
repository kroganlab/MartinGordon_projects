Follow-up from the RNAseq analysis of the RFe and MRC5 comparison of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
Experimental conditions:  WT (WA-1), N_P80T variant, 9b_T72I_N_P80T variant
Experimental timepoints: 6, 12, 24, 48hr

First goal: look at the AB and PH data: first perform comparisons of the time-matched viral groups.
Then look at the viral response to infection overtime
Finally compare to the timematched RNAseq data; do we see good agreement in the two omics methods?
